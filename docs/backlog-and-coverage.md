# Backlog and Coverage Tracker

Use this to track what exists, what needs work, and gaps to fill.

## Pages and Sections (status)
- Home: hero, tagline, learning tools, services, pricing teaser, register CTA
- Pricing: pricing table (Basic, Premium, Enterprise)
- About: mission, vision, team, values, stats
- Contact: hero, form, FAQ
- Teacher platform: hero, tools, lesson modules, benefits, CTA
- Student platform: hero, characters, planets carousel, CTA
- Courses: placeholder
- Auth flows: login, register, forgot/reset (static pages)

## Current Gaps / To-Do
- Content: fill Courses page; enrich FAQs with platform-specific questions; align pricing blurbs with table plans.
- Data: move hardcoded cards/pricing/modules to a config/data source; add loading/empty states.
- Auth/CTA routing: centralize register/login redirect rules per role; add post-auth redirect handling.
- Accessibility: carousel controls ARIA review; focus states on buttons/links; ensure form error messaging.
- Testing: extend Cypress to cover pricing CTAs, register flow links, student planets controls pause/play.
